Only UBS workers in roles that require them to be in the office, such as those in supervisory positions, or in trading and branch roles, will have less flexibility, the bank said. However, an internal analysis of the 72,000 UBS employees globally showed that around two-thirds are in roles that would allow them to combine working remotely and in the office. The Swiss bank’s approach stands in contrast to some of the major Wall Street banks. Goldman Sachs, for example, asked its employees in the U.S. and U.K. to come back into the office this month. JPMorgan Chase also told its U.S. workers that it was aiming to get half of its employees rotating through the office by July. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has said he believes that by “sometime in September, October it will look just like it did before.” Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman has also been outspoken on the matter. “If you can go into a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office and we want you in the office,” Gorman reportedly said.'''\n",
